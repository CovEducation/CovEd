The workshop will last for 4 weeks from July 6th-August 1st, 2020. The weekly structure of the workshop will include a writing prompt for each week, anonymous submission and feedback of each otherâ€™s work based on this prompt, as well as a short lecture on the mechanics of creative writing. The mentors will organize weekly office hours, where attendees can receive feedback about their writing related to the writing prompt or other writing.
